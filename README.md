Really you can just edit the examplesql.sql file and it will spit out sql for 8 or so langauges (including English which is what I'm assuming you're writing the sql in), adding other languages can be done either at request or by yourself. 

When you go to run you might need to pip install some packages, also be sure to read the comment in the .py file, because it is very thorough. 

Remember to create your own credentials and replace the `/Users/your-user/path-to-creds/Project-creds.json` with the path to your json credentials

if you need help feel free to ask

Enjoy!
